# library-menu-list
This project is a library management panel and administrators (librarians) can do many things like (adding books to the book list, adding users to the user list, editing book information, etc.) This project exists to simplify library operations.

### The main structure of this project
First, it receives the number of books and users from the administrator. Then, it displays a list of capabilities and activities that an administrator can perform, and selecting each of these options performs an action. Administrators can select each option by entering the desired number in the list. And until the administrator selects the exit option, the list of capabilities is displayed to the administrator after each operation.
